# Business Requirements Document

## Project: Code Generation Tool - Cursor

---

### Executive Summary

The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the development of a code generation tool, similar to Cursor, that will enhance productivity, accuracy, and efficiency in software development. This tool will leverage advanced algorithms to generate code snippets, modules, and entire projects based on user-defined parameters and inputs. The project is driven by the need to streamline coding processes and reduce manual coding errors, thereby enabling developers to focus on higher-level design and problem-solving tasks.

### Scope and Deliverables

#### Scope

- Development of a code generation tool capable of creating code in multiple programming languages.
- Integration with popular development environments (IDEs) to ensure seamless workflow integration.
- Implementation of a user-friendly interface for defining code generation parameters.
- Provision of a library of templates for common coding tasks and patterns.

#### Deliverables

1. **Code Generation Engine**: A robust backend engine capable of interpreting user inputs and generating appropriate code.
2. **User Interface**: An intuitive front-end interface that allows users to interact with the tool efficiently.
3. **IDE Plugins**: Extensions for popular IDEs to integrate code generation capabilities directly into the development workflow.
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive user manuals and API documentation to facilitate ease of use and integration.
5. **Testing and QA Reports**: Detailed reports on testing phases and quality assurance checks performed prior to release.
6. **Support and Maintenance Plan**: A strategy for ongoing support, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.

### Functional Requirements

1. **Multi-language Support**: The tool must support at least five major programming languages at launch, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, and Ruby.
2. **Template Library**: Provide a library of customizable templates for common code structures such as loops, conditionals, and classes.
3. **Parameter Input Interface**: Enable users to define parameters such as variable names, data types, and method signatures.
4. **Real-time Code Preview**: Display a real-time preview of the generated code as parameters are inputted.
5. **Version Control Integration**: Allow integration with Git and other version control systems for seamless code management.
6. **Export Options**: Support exporting generated code in different formats, including plain text and IDE-specific project files.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The tool should generate code snippets in under 2 seconds after receiving input.
2. **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle concurrent usage by at least 500 users without degradation in performance.
3. **Security**: Ensure the tool follows best practices for data protection and user privacy, including secure handling of user inputs and outputs.
4. **Usability**: The interface should adhere to usability standards, ensuring ease of navigation and interaction for users with varying levels of expertise.
5. **Reliability**: The tool should maintain 99.9% uptime to ensure consistent availability for users.

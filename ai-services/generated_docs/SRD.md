# Software Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the software requirements for the development of a code generation tool similar to Cursor. This document serves as a guide for developers, project managers, and stakeholders to understand the functionality, architecture, and constraints of the proposed system.

### 1.2 Scope
This project aims to develop a sophisticated code generation tool capable of assisting developers by suggesting code snippets, auto-completing code, and generating boilerplate code across various programming languages. The system will leverage machine learning algorithms to improve the quality and relevance of suggestions over time.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **ML**: Machine Learning

### 1.4 References
- Cursor documentation
- Industry standards for code generation tools
- User feedback from existing tools

## 2. System Overview

The system is a code generation tool designed to integrate seamlessly with popular IDEs. It will function as a plugin or standalone application, providing real-time code suggestions, auto-completions, and generation of boilerplate code. The tool will support multiple programming languages and will continuously learn from user interactions to enhance its predictive capabilities.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Code Suggestion
- The tool shall provide real-time code suggestions based on the context within the user's codebase.
- Suggestions should be relevant to the current programming language and framework.

### 3.2 Code Auto-completion
- The tool must offer auto-completions for partially typed code constructs.
- It should recognize and suggest variables, functions, and classes within the current scope.

### 3.3 Boilerplate Code Generation
- Users shall be able to generate boilerplate code for common design patterns and file structures.
- The tool should allow customization of boilerplate templates.

### 3.4 Multi-language Support
- The system shall support at least five major programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, and Ruby.
- Language support should be easily extensible.

### 3.5 Learning and Adaptation
- The tool must adapt to the user's coding style and preferences over time.
- It should employ machine learning techniques to improve suggestion accuracy.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Platform Compatibility
- The tool must be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
- It should integrate with major IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse.

### 4.2 Performance
- The system should provide suggestions within milliseconds to ensure a seamless user experience.
- It must handle large codebases efficiently.

### 4.3 Scalability
- The architecture should support scalability to accommodate increasing numbers of users and projects.

## 5. System Architecture

The system will be built on a modular architecture comprising client and server components. The client component will reside within the user's IDE, facilitating real-time interaction. The server component will handle complex processing tasks such as machine learning model training and updates.

- **Client Component**: Lightweight, responsive, IDE integration
- **Server Component**: Model training, data storage, API services

## 6. Interface Requirements

### 6.1 User Interface
- The user interface should be intuitive and non-intrusive, allowing users to interact with suggestions effortlessly.
- Customization options for themes and keybindings should be available.

### 6.2 External Interfaces
- **IDE Plugin Interfaces**: APIs for integration with supported IDEs.
- **API Interfaces**: RESTful APIs for server-client communication.

## 7. Data Requirements

- **User Data**: Preferences, coding styles, and interaction history should be securely stored.
- **Code Data**: Code snippets and structures should be stored to enhance suggestion algorithms while ensuring user privacy.

## 8. Security Requirements

- The system must ensure data privacy and protection, complying with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR.
- Secure authentication mechanisms should be implemented for user accounts.

## 9. Performance Requirements

- The tool must provide real-time feedback with minimal latency.
- It should efficiently manage resources to avoid excessive CPU and memory usage, particularly within the IDE environment.
